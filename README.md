This is a small board I made to give a 3D printed C3P0 head controllable eyes and sound.

I have included my code.  It uses a DFPlay and the sound files are stored on the sd card.  The should be placed placed under the SD card root directory and the mp3 file name needs to be 4 digits, for example, "0001.mp3", placed under the mp3 folder.
